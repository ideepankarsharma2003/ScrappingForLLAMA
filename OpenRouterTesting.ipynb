       "'15 benefits of drinking water and other water facts  Health ConditionsHealth ProductsDiscoverToolsConnectSubscribeFifteen benefits of drinking water by  — By  — Water is crucial for many bodily functions, such as lubricating the joints, delivering oxygen throughout the body, preventing kidney damage, and more.Around  of the body is made up of water, and around  of the planet’s surface is covered by water.Perhaps it is the ubiquitous nature of water that means drinking enough each day is not at the top of many people’s lists of priorities.Fast facts on drinking waterAdult humans are 60 percent water, and our blood is 90 percent water.There is no universally agreed quantity of water that must be consumed daily.Water is essential for the kidneys and other bodily functions.When dehydrated, the skin can become more vulnerable to skin disorders and wrinkling.Drinking water instead of soda can help with weight loss.Was this helpful?Possible benefits of drinking water range from keeping the kidneys healthy to losing weight.To function properly, all the cells and organs of the body need water.Here are  our body needs water:1. It lubricates the jointsCartilage, found in joints and the disks of the spine, contains around 80 percent water. Long-term  can reduce the joints’ shock-absorbing ability, leading to joint pain.2. It forms saliva and mucusSaliva helps us digest our food and keeps the mouth, nose, and eyes moist. This prevents friction and damage. Drinking water also keeps the mouth clean. Consumed instead of sweetened beverages, it can also reduce tooth decay.3. It delivers oxygen throughout the bodyBlood is more than 90 percent water, and blood carries oxygen to different parts of the body.4. It boosts skin health and beautyWith dehydration, the skin can become more vulnerable to skin disorders and premature wrinkling.5. It cushions the brain, spinal cord, and other sensitive tissuesDehydration can affect brain structure and function. It is also involved in the production of hormones and neurotransmitters. Prolonged dehydration can lead to problems with thinking and reasoning.6. It regulates body temperatureWater that is stored in the middle layers of the skin  as sweat when the body heats up. As it evaporates, it cools the body. In sport.Some scientists have  when there is too little water in the body, heat storage increases and the individual is less able to tolerate heat strain.Having a lot of water in the body may reduce physical strain if heat  occurs during exercise. However, more research is needed into these effects.7, The digestive system depends on itThe bowel needs water to work properly. Dehydration can lead to digestive problems, , and an overly acidic stomach. This increases the risk of  and stomach ulcers.8. It flushes body wasteWater is needed in the processes of sweating and removal of urine and feces.9. It helps maintain blood pressureA lack of water can cause blood to become thicker, increasing .10. The airways need itWhen dehydrated, airways are restricted by the body in an effort to minimize water loss. This can make  and allergies worse.11. It makes minerals and nutrients accessibleThese , which makes it possible for them to reach different parts of the body.12. It prevents kidney damageThe kidneys regulate fluid in the body. Insufficient water can lead to  and other problems.13. It boosts performance during exerciseDehydration during exercise may hinder performance.Some scientists have proposed that consuming more water might enhance performance during strenuous activity.More research is needed to confirm this, but one  dehydration reduces performance in activities lasting longer than 30 minutes.14. Weight lossWater may also help with weight loss, if it is consumed instead of sweetened juices and sodas. “Preloading” with water before meals can help prevent overeating by creating a sense of fullness.15. It reduces the chance of a hangoverWhen partying, unsweetened soda water with ice and lemon alternated with alcoholic drinks can help prevent overconsumption of alcohol.Water helps dissolve minerals and nutrients, making them more accessible to the body. It also helps remove waste products.The kidneys play a key role in balancing fluid levels.These two functions make water vital to the kidneys.Every day, the kidneys filter around  of fluid.Of these, approximately 1-2 quarts are removed from the body in the form of urine, and the rest is recovered by the bloodstream.Water is essential for the kidneys to function.If the kidneys do not function properly, waste products and  can build up inside the body.Untreated,  can lead to kidney failure. The organs stop working, and either dialysis or kidney transplantation is required. (UTIs) are the  type of infection in the body. They account for around 8.1 million visits to health care providers in the U.S. every year.If infections spread to the upper urinary tract, including the kidneys, permanent damage can result. Sudden, or acute, kidney infections can be life-threatening, particularly if septicemia occurs.Drinking plenty of water is a simple way to reduce the risk of developing a UTI and to help treat an existing UTI.Kidney stones interfere with how the kidneys work. When present, can complicate UTIs. These complicated UTIs tend to require longer periods of  to treat them, typically lasting 7 to 14 days.The leading cause of kidney stones is a lack of water. People who report them often do not drink the recommended daily amount of water. Kidney stones may also increase the risk of .In November 2014, the American College of Physicians issued  for people who have previously developed kidney stones. The guidelines state that increasing fluid intake to enable 2 liters of urination a day could decrease the risk of stone recurrence by at least half with no side effects. happens if we use and lose more water than the body takes in. It can lead to an imbalance in the body’s electrolytes. Electrolytes, such as , phosphate, and sodium, help carry electrical signals between cells. The kidneys keep the levels of electrolytes in the body stable when they function properly.When the kidneys are unable to maintain a balance in the levels of electrolytes, these electrical signals become mixed up. This can lead to seizures, involving involuntary muscle movements and loss of consciousness.In severe cases, dehydration can lead to kidney failure, which can be life-threatening. Possible complications of  include , damage to the , , and a compromised immune system.Some of the water required by the body is obtained through foods with a high water content, such as soups, tomatoes, oranges, but most come through drinking water and other beverages.During everyday functioning, water is lost by the body, and this needs to be replaced. We notice that we lose water through activities such as sweating and urination, but water is lost even when breathing.Drinking water, whether from the tap or a bottle, is the best source of fluid for the body.Milk and juices are also good sources of fluid, but beverages containing alcohol and caffeine, such as soft drinks, , and beer, are not ideal because they often contain empty . Drinking  can help with weight loss.It was previously thought that caffeinated beverages had diuretic properties, meaning that they cause the body to release water. However,  that fluid loss because of caffeinated drinks is minimal. How much water we need to consume is influenced by the climate.The amount of water needed each day , depending on how active they are, how much they sweat, and so on.There is no fixed amount of water that must be consumed daily, but there is general agreement on what a healthy fluid intake is.According to the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the average recommended daily intake of water from both food and drink is:For men: Around For women: Around 2.7 liters or 91 ouncesThis would be around 15.5 cups for men and just over 11 cups for women. However, around 80 percent of this should come from drinks, including water, and the rest will be from food.This means that:Men should drink around 100 ounces, or 12.5 cups of fluidWomen should drink around 73 ounces, or just over 9 cupsFresh fruits and vegetables and all non-alcoholic fluids count towards this recommendation. Times when it is most important to drink plenty of water include:when you have a when the weather is hotif you have  and vomitingwhen you sweat a lot, for example, due to physical activityHere are some facts about water:Babies and children have a higher percentage of water than adults. When babies are born, they are about  water, but this falls to 65 percent by the age of 1 year.Fatty tissue has less water than lean tissue.Men have more water than women, as a percentage.Do we drink enough water?A study carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2013 analyzed data from the National Cancer Institute’s 2007 .Out of a sample of 3,397 adults, the researchers found:7 percent of adults reported no daily consumption of drinking water36 percent of adults reported drinking 1-3 cups of drinking water a day35 percent of adults reported drinking 4-7 cups of drinking water a day22 percent of adults reported drinking 8 cups or more a dayPeople were more likely to drink less than 4 cups of drinking water daily if they consumed 1 cup or less of fruits or vegetables a day.The study only measured the intake of drinking water. Fluid can be gained from other beverages, but water is best because it is calorie-free, caffeine-free, and alcohol-free.Seven percent of respondents reported drinking no water at all daily, and those who drank a low volume of water also consumed less fruit and vegetables. This suggests that a certain number of people are risking their health by not getting enough fluid.Even if the respondents reporting low levels of water intake were obtaining enough fluid, it is likely that they would be obtaining it from sources that could potentially compromise their health in other ways.“The biologic requirement for water may be met with plain water or via foods and other beverages,” write the study authors. “Results from previous epidemiologic studies indicate that water intake may be inversely related to volume of calorically sweetened beverages and other fluid intake.” Last medically reviewed on  July 16, 2018How we reviewed this article:SourcesMedical News Today has strict sourcing guidelines and draws only from peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

It lubricates the jointsCartilage, found in joints and the disks of the spine, contains around 80 percent water. Long-term  can reduce the joints’ shock-absorbing ability, leading to joint pain.2. It forms saliva and mucusSaliva helps us digest our food and keeps the mouth, nose, and eyes moist. This prevents friction and damage. Drinking water also keeps the mouth clean. Consumed instead of sweetened beverages, it can also reduce tooth decay.3. It delivers oxygen throughout the bodyBlood is more than 90 percent water, and blood carries oxygen to different parts of the body.4. It boosts skin health and beautyWith dehydration, the skin can become more vulnerable to skin disorders and premature wrinkling.5. It cushions the brain, spinal cord, and other sensitive tissuesDehydration can affect brain structure and function. It is also involved in the production of hormones and neurotransmitters. Prolonged dehydration can lead to problems with thinking and reasoning.6. It regulates body temperatureWater that is stored in the middle layers of the skin  as sweat when the body heats up. As it evaporates, it cools the body. In sport.Some scientists have  when there is too little water in the body, heat storage increases and the individual is less able to tolerate heat strain.Having a lot of water in the body may reduce physical strain if heat  occurs during exercise. However, more research is needed into these effects.7, The digestive system depends on itThe bowel needs water to work properly. Dehydration can lead to digestive problems, , and an overly acidic stomach. This increases the risk of  and stomach ulcers.8. It flushes body wasteWater is needed in the processes of sweating and removal of urine and feces.9. It helps maintain blood pressureA lack of water can cause blood to become thicker, increasing .10. The airways need itWhen dehydrated, airways are restricted by the body in an effort to minimize water loss. This can make  and allergies worse.11. It makes minerals and nutrients accessibleThese , which makes it possible for them to reach different parts of the body.12. It prevents kidney damageThe kidneys regulate fluid in the body. Insufficient water can lead to  and other problems.13. It boosts performance during exerciseDehydration during exercise may hinder performance.Some scientists have proposed that consuming more water might enhance performance during strenuous activity.More research is needed to confirm this, but one  dehydration reduces performance in activities lasting longer than 30 minutes.14. Weight lossWater may also help with weight loss, if it is consumed instead of sweetened juices and sodas. “Preloading” with water before meals can help prevent overeating by creating a sense of fullness.15. It reduces the chance of a hangoverWhen partying, unsweetened soda water with ice and lemon alternated with alcoholic drinks can help prevent overconsumption of alcohol.Water helps dissolve minerals and nutrients, making them more accessible to the body. It also helps remove waste products.The kidneys play a key role in balancing fluid levels.These two functions make water vital to the kidneys.Every day, the kidneys filter around  of fluid.Of these, approximately 1-2 quarts are removed from the body in the form of urine, and the rest is recovered by the bloodstream.Water is essential for the kidneys to function.If the kidneys do not function properly, waste products and  can build up inside the body.Untreated,  can lead to kidney failure. The organs stop working, and either dialysis or kidney transplantation is required. (UTIs) are the  type of infection in the body. They account for around 8.1 million visits to health care providers in the U.S. every year.If infections spread to the upper urinary tract, including the kidneys, permanent damage can result. Sudden, or acute, kidney infections can be life-threatening, particularly if septicemia occurs.Drinking plenty of water is a simple way to reduce the risk of developing a UTI and to help treat an existing UTI.Kidney stones interfere with how the kidneys work. When present, can complicate UTIs. These complicated UTIs tend to require longer periods of  to treat them, typically lasting 7 to 14 days.The leading cause of kidney stones is a lack of water. People who report them often do not drink the recommended daily amount of water. Kidney stones may also increase the risk of .In November 2014, the American College of Physicians issued  for people who have previously developed kidney stones. The guidelines state that increasing fluid intake to enable 2 liters of urination a day could decrease the risk of stone recurrence by at least half with no side effects. happens if we use and lose more water than the body takes in. It can lead to an imbalance in the body’s electrolytes. Electrolytes, such as , phosphate, and sodium, help carry electrical signals between cells. The kidneys keep the levels of electrolytes in the body stable when they function properly.When the kidneys are unable to maintain a balance in the levels of electrolytes, these electrical signals become mixed up. This can lead to seizures, involving involuntary muscle movements and loss of consciousness.In severe cases, dehydration can lead to kidney failure, which can be life-threatening. Possible complications of  include , damage to the , , and a compromised immune system.Some of the water required by the body is obtained through foods with a high water content, such as soups, tomatoes, oranges, but most come through drinking water and other beverages.During everyday functioning, water is lost by the body, and this needs to be replaced. We notice that we lose water through activities such as sweating and urination, but water is lost even when breathing.Drinking water, whether from the tap or a bottle, is the best source of fluid for the body.Milk and juices are also good sources of fluid, but beverages containing alcohol and caffeine, such as soft drinks, , and beer, are not ideal because they often contain empty . Drinking  can help with weight loss.It was previously thought that caffeinated beverages had diuretic properties, meaning that they cause the body to release water. However,  that fluid loss because of caffeinated drinks is minimal. How much water we need to consume is influenced by the climate.The amount of water needed each day , depending on how active they are, how much they sweat, and so on.There is no fixed amount of water that must be consumed daily, but there is general agreement on what a healthy fluid intake is.According to the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the average recommended daily intake of water from both food and drink is:For men: Around For women: Around 2.7 liters or 91 ouncesThis would be around 15.5 cups for men and just over 11 cups for women. However, around 80 percent of this should come from drinks, including water, and the rest will be from food.This means that:Men should drink around 100 ounces, or 12.5 cups of fluidWomen should drink around 73 ounces, or just over 9 cupsFresh fruits and vegetables and all non-alcoholic fluids count towards this recommendation. Times when it is most important to drink plenty of water include:when you have a when the weather is hotif you have  and vomitingwhen you sweat a lot, for example, due to physical activityHere are some facts about water:Babies and children have a higher percentage of water than adults. When babies are born, they are about  water, but this falls to 65 percent by the age of 1 year.Fatty tissue has less water than lean tissue.Men have more water than women, as a percentage.Do we drink enough water?A study carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2013 analyzed data from the National Cancer Institute’s 2007 .Out of a sample of 3,397 adults, the researchers found:7 percent of adults reported no daily consumption of drinking water36 percent of adults reported drinking 1-3 cups of drinking water a day35 percent of adults reported drinking 4-7 cups of drinking water a day22 percent of adults reported drinking 8 cups or more a dayPeople were more likely to drink less than 4 cups of drinking water daily if they consumed 1 cup or less of fruits or vegetables a day.The study only measured the intake of drinking water. Fluid can be gained from other beverages, but water is best because it is calorie-free, caffeine-free, and alcohol-free.Seven percent of respondents reported drinking no water at all daily, and those who drank a low volume of water also consumed less fruit and vegetables. This suggests that a certain number of people are risking their health by not getting enough fluid.Even if the respondents reporting low levels of water intake were obtaining enough fluid, it is likely that they would be obtaining it from sources that could potentially compromise their health in other ways.“The biologic requirement for water may be met with plain water or via foods and other beverages,” write the study authors. “Results from previous epidemiologic studies indicate that water intake may be inversely related to volume of calorically sweetened beverages and other fluid intake.” Last medically reviewed on  July 16, 2018How we reviewed this article:SourcesMedical News Today has strict sourcing guidelines and draws only from peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.
