It is a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters, with checkpoints finetuned for chat application! The abstract from the paper is the following: In this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama 2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Our models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and based on our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, may be a suitable substitute for closed-source models. We provide a detailed description of our approach to fine-tuning and safety improvements of Llama 2-Chat in order to enable the community to build on our work and contribute to the responsible development of LLMs. Checkout all Llama2 models  Tips: Weights for the Llama2 models can be obtained by filling out  The architecture is very similar to the first Llama, with the addition of Grouped Query Attention (GQA) following this  Setting config.pretraining_tp to a value different than 1 will activate the more accurate but slower computation of the linear layers, which should better match the original logits. The original model uses pad_id = -1 which means that there is no padding token. We can’t have the same logic, make sure to add a padding token using tokenizer.add_special_tokens({\"pad_token\":\"<pad>\"}) and resize the token embedding accordingly. You should also set the model.config.pad_token_id. The embed_tokens layer of the model is initialized with self.embed_tokens = nn.Embedding(config.vocab_size, config.hidden_size, self.config.padding_idx), which makes sure that encoding the padding token will output zeros, so passing it when initializing is recommended. After filling out the form and gaining access to the model checkpoints, you should be able to use the already converted checkpoints. Otherwise, if you are converting your own model, feel free to use the . The script can be called with the following (example) command:    Copied python src/transformers/models/llama/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py \\\\     --input_dir /path/to/downloaded/llama/weights --model_size 7B --output_dir /output/path After conversion, the model and tokenizer can be loaded via:    Copied from transformers import LlamaForCausalLM, LlamaTokenizer  tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"/output/path\") model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"/output/path\") Note that executing the script requires enough CPU RAM to host the whole model in float16 precision (even if the biggest versions come in several checkpoints they each contain a part of each weight of the model, so we need to load them all in RAM). For the 75B model, it’s thus 145GB of RAM needed. The LLaMA tokenizer is a BPE model based on . One quirk of sentencepiece is that when decoding a sequence, if the first token is the start of the word (e.g. “Banana”), the tokenizer does not prepend the prefix space to the string. This model was contributed by  with contributions from . The code of the implementation in Hugging Face is based on GPT-NeoX . The original code of the authors can be found .

This is an experimental feature, subject to breaking API changes in future versions. Example —    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a . It is used to instantiate an LLaMA model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture.

The LLaMa Model transformer with a sequence classification head on top (linear layer).  uses the last token in order to do the classification, as other causal models (e.g. GPT-2) do.

If a pad_token_id is defined in the configuration, it finds the last token that is not a padding token in each row. If no pad_token_id is defined, it simply takes the last value in each row of the batch. Since it cannot guess the padding tokens when inputs_embeds are passed instead of input_ids, it does the same (take the last value in each row of the batch). This model inherits from .

Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.  forward   ( input_ids: LongTensor = None attention_mask: typing.Optional[torch.Tensor] = None position_ids: typing.Optional[torch.LongTensor] = None past_key_values: typing.Optional[typing.List[torch.FloatTensor]] = None inputs_embeds: typing.Optional[torch.FloatTensor] = None labels: typing.Optional[torch.LongTensor] = None use_cache: typing.Optional[bool] = None output_attentions: typing.Optional[bool] = None output_hidden_states: typing.Optional[bool] = None return_dict: typing.Optional[bool] = None  )   Parameters   input_ids (torch.LongTensor of shape (batch_size, sequence_length)) — Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default should you provide it. Indices can be obtained using . See  and  for details.    attention_mask (torch.Tensor of shape (batch_size, sequence_length), optional) — Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in [0, 1]:  1 for tokens that are not masked, 0 for tokens that are masked.   Indices can be obtained using . See  and  for details. If past_key_values is used, optionally only the last decoder_input_ids have to be input (see past_key_values). If you want to change padding behavior, you should read modeling_opt._prepare_decoder_attention_mask and modify to your needs. See diagram 1 in  for more information on the default strategy.  1 indicates the head is not masked, 0 indicates the head is masked.    position_ids (torch.LongTensor of shape (batch_size, sequence_length), optional) — Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. Selected in the range [0, config.n_positions - 1].    past_key_values (tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor)), optional, returned when use_cache=True is passed or when config.use_cache=True) — Tuple of tuple(torch.FloatTensor) of length config.n_layers, with each tuple having 2 tensors of shape (batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)) and 2 additional tensors of shape (batch_size, num_heads, encoder_sequence_length, embed_size_per_head). Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention blocks) that can be used (see past_key_values input) to speed up sequential decoding. If past_key_values are used, the user can optionally input only the last decoder_input_ids (those that don’t have their past key value states given to this model) of shape (batch_size, 1) instead of all decoder_input_ids of shape (batch_size, sequence_length).   inputs_embeds (torch.FloatTensor of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size), optional) — Optionally, instead of passing input_ids you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This is useful if you want more control over how to convert input_ids indices into associated vectors than the model’s internal embedding lookup matrix.   use_cache (bool, optional) — If set to True, past_key_values key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see past_key_values).   output_attentions (bool, optional) — Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See attentions under returned tensors for more detail.   output_hidden_states (bool, optional) — Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See hidden_states under returned tensors for more detail.   return_dict (bool, optional) — Whether or not to return a  instead of a plain tuple.   labels (torch.LongTensor of shape (batch_size,), optional) — Labels for computing the sequence classification/regression loss. Indices should be in [0, ..., config.num_labels - 1]. If config.num_labels == 1 a regression loss is computed (Mean-Square loss), If config.num_labels > 1 a classification loss is computed (Cross-Entropy).    The  forward method, overrides the __call__ special method. Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the Module instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.'"

Setup In a conda env with PyTorch / CUDA available, clone the repo and run in the top-level directory: pip install -e .  Inference Different models require different model-parallel (MP) values:    Model MP     7B 1   13B 2   70B 8    All models support sequence length up to 4096 tokens, but we pre-allocate the cache according to max_seq_len and max_batch_size values. So set those according to your hardware. Pretrained Models These models are not finetuned for chat or Q&A. They should be prompted so that the expected answer is the natural continuation of the prompt. See example_text_completion.py for some examples. To illustrate, see command below to run it with the llama-2-7b model (nproc_per_node needs to be set to the MP value): torchrun --nproc_per_node 1 example_text_completion.py \\     --ckpt_dir llama-2-7b/ \\     --tokenizer_path tokenizer.model \\     --max_seq_len 128 --max_batch_size 4  Fine-tuned Chat Models The fine-tuned models were trained for dialogue applications. To get the expected features and performance for them, a specific formatting defined in  needs to be followed, including the INST and <<SYS>> tags, BOS and EOS tokens, and the whitespaces and breaklines in between (we recommend calling strip() on inputs to avoid double-spaces). You can also deploy additional classifiers for filtering out inputs and outputs that are deemed unsafe. See the llama-recipes repo for  of how to add a safety checker to the inputs and outputs of your inference code. Examples using llama-2-7b-chat: torchrun --nproc_per_node 1 example_chat_completion.py \\     --ckpt_dir llama-2-7b-chat/ \\     --tokenizer_path tokenizer.model \\     --max_seq_len 512 --max_batch_size 4  Llama 2 is a new technology that carries potential risks with use. Testing conducted to date has not — and could not — cover all scenarios. In order to help developers address these risks, we have created the .
