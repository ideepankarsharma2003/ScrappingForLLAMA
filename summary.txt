It played our test games with a few issues, but it may be related to my test PC running on older hardware.The stable version of PrimeOS runs Android 7. a few hundred games are supported at the time of writing, but once Google Play supports Windows 11 in full, we don’t think any emulator is going to be as good as Windows 11 unless you need power-user tools like keymapping, which Windows 11 doesn’t offer at this time. There are three main uses for an Android emulator: gaming, app development, and productivity. Some of the more hardcore mobile gamers will also run their games in an Android emulator to give their phone a break, or use it to multi-instance farm.The second most popular use case is for app development. Plus, some  at running Android apps than emulators. That said, some apps like Instagram limit features outside of the mobile space, so using an Android emulator is still sometimes the best option.

.How to watch Super Bowl 2023Watch it live, with or without cable.cmannphoto via Getty Images|February 9, 2023 10:30 AMAn  two thirds of the US population watched the Super Bowl last year – and it didn’t even have Rihanna. Airing rights to the Super Bowl rotate annually between broadcasters and since 2007, the game has alternated between CBS, Fox and NBC (ABC will get a turn in 2027). As it’s Fox’s year, you can watch the game on local Fox broadcast stations and on Fox channels offered through your cable or satellite TV provider, including Fox Sports 1 and the Spanish-language Fox Desportes. Even basic cable services include access to your local Fox channel, and most also include Fox Sports 1, both of which will air the game. Having a cable or satellite subscription also means you can log into the standalone Fox Sports app and watch via your smart TV or computer. How to watch Super Bowl 2023 without cable For those who’ve cut the cord, live TV streaming offers a bunch of ways to watch. A few – but not all – of those services will let you watch the Super Bowl this year. Here’s a list of providers that carry Fox Sports, along with their monthly subscription fees:   - $40 per month, $20 first month  - $65 per month  - $70 per month  (Pro tier) - $75 per month  (Entertainment tier) - $75 per month  Sling TV is the cheapest way to watch the game with live streaming, and the channel lineup  access to Fox Sports 1 with their Blue package. How to watch the Super Bowl on mobile If it’s just you watching and you’re thinking of using your smartphone or tablet,  is an over-the-top subscription app that’s $5 per month or $13 for the NFL season (which ends with the Super Bowl). How to watch the Super Bowl for free We reached out to Fox Sports to ask how to watch the game for free and a customer service rep said, "Super Bowl 57 has been made available to all who would like to stream without a TV provider. Super Bowl 57 will stream on a number of platforms: watch it on the,  FOX Sports app, FOX NOW app, and the NFL+ app." They went on to say this access only applies to the game itself. Local Fox stations will broadcast the Super Bowl over the airwaves and access there is also free, provided you have a way to receive the signal.

Stranger Things' Eddie Munson: Origin Story Novel ComingThe Future Is HereWe may earn a commission from links on this pageStranger Things' Eddie Munson Is Finally Getting a Proper Origin StoryThe fan-favorite Netflix character played by Joseph Quinn takes center stage in Flight of Icarus, an official season four prequel novel.ByPublishedApril 13, 2023We may earn a commission from links on this page.Joseph Quinn as Eddie Munson on Stranger Things.Image: NetflixWe all know how  : heroically facing beasties in the Upside Down  . But how did Eddie, who was played by Joseph Quinn in the hit Netflix series, get to be so rad in the first place? CCShare SubtitlesOffEnglishShare this Video has revealed the cover and synopsis for Stranger Things: Flight of Icarus by Caitlin Schneiderhan. The author is part of Stranger Things season five’s writers’ room and describes Flight of Icarus as a lens into seeing Eddie become “the brave misfit we all know and love.” The book is set in 1984—Stranger Things’ fourth season was set in 1986; for context, its first season was 1983—and will be out October 31.AdvertisementThe Stranger Things writers’ room Twitter shared the cover with some praise for their cohort:AdvertisementAdvertisementHere’s the synopsis as revealed by EW:Hawkins, Indiana — for most, it’s simply another idyllic, manicured all-American town. But for Eddie Munson it’s like living in a perpetual Tomb of Horrors. It’s at the worst dive bar in town that Eddie meets Paige, someone who has pulled off a freaking miracle. She escaped Hawkins and built a wickedly cool life for herself working for a record producer out in Los Angeles. Money Eddie doesn’t have. His dad just stumbled back into his life, with another dubious scheme up his sleeve, and yet Eddie knows this is his only option to make enough dough in enough time. Eddie can feel it: 1984 is going to be his year.The cover may suggest Eddie in all his “fighting Vecna with the power of metal” glory, but it looks like the book will be more about Eddie’s own character-building experiences than it will involve anything supernatural. (That said, the music biz surely contains its own breed of nightmares.) Also, we of course know that escaping Hawkins wasn’t in the cards for Eddie... Eddie might be a one-season Stranger Things wonder, but , so he clearly hasn’t been scared away from the horror genre.

TRIPE knocks this down to 65, but if you lucked out with TRIED then just four answers would be left over.(Image credit: Alan Martin)With only one letter uncovered, I wanted a word that would test some of the common characters that I couldn't fit into my first turn: 'E', 'L' and 'S'. I did that by playing DICEY, which was incredibly effective, turning 'E' green, adding a yellow 'D' and leaving just two possible answers.But crucially, my instincts were wrong and today's Wordle answer is one of those rare words where 'I' starts or ends the word.

With a lease, buyers make a monthly payment to drive a new car for a set term. That payment is often less than the monthly cost of financing a new vehicle, but buyers must return the car at the end of the lease term. If a lease’s limitations put you off, consider buying a less expensive new car or a well-maintained used car, such as a certified pre-owned vehicle from a franchised dealer, or getting a longer loan term. You get to use it but must return it at the end of the lease unless you decide to buy it.Up-Front CostsThey include the cash price or a down payment, taxes, registration, and other fees.They can include the first month’s payment, a refundable security deposit, an acquisition fee, a down payment, taxes, registration, and other fees.Monthly PaymentsLoan payments are usually higher than lease payments because you’re paying off the entire purchase price of the vehicle, plus interest and other finance charges, taxes, and fees.Lease payments are almost always lower than loan payments because you’re paying only for the vehicle’s depreciation during the lease term, plus interest charges (called rent charges), taxes, and fees.Early TerminationYou can sell or trade in your vehicle at any time. On occasion a dealer may buy the car from the leasing company as a trade-in, letting you off the hook.Vehicle ReturnYou’ll have to deal with selling or trading in your car when you decide you want a different one.You return the vehicle at lease-end, pay any end-of-lease costs, and walk away.Future ValueThe vehicle will depreciate, but its cash value is yours to use as you like.On the plus side, its future value doesn’t affect you financially. You’ll have to pay extra charges for exceeding what is considered normal wear and tear.End of TermAt the end of the loan term, you have no further payments and you have built equity to help pay for your next vehicle.At the end of the lease (usually two to three years), you can finance the purchase of the car, or lease or buy another.CustomizingThe vehicle is yours to modify or customize as you like, although doing so may void your warranty.Because you must return the vehicle in salable condition, any modifications or custom parts you add have to be removed. Should You Buy or Lease a New Car?
But this time, the PS5 has an uphill battle to convince everyone that it’s a necessary purchase.It isn’t a gateway to gaming in a new resolution in the way that previous console generations were, and you don’t even need to buy one to play the latest games – there are almost no titles in its entire catalogue that can’t also be played on PS4.But the PS5 has some unexpected tricks up its sleeve that make it feel like a proper generational upgrade and, ultimately, give it a leg up over the Xbox Series X.PriceThe PS5 is out now, priced at £450 ($500, AU$750), the same price Microsoft is charging for its .There is a more affordable PS5 Digital Edition (£360, $400, AU$600) which, according to Sony, is identical to the standard PS5 in terms of performance and specs but lacks an optical disc drive. Perhaps this Marmite-like reaction is precisely what Sony was going for.You can at least position it vertically rather than horizontally if that better suits your furniture and/or tastes, but swapping orientation involves unscrewing and repositioning the included pedestal stand: the console’s curves mean it won’t simply lie flat.PS5 tech specs(Image credit: Future)Maximum resolution 4KMaximum frame rate 120fpsStorage 825GB SSDOutputs HDMI 2.1, 3.5mm headphone jack (on controller), USB (Type-A) x3, USB-CAudio formats Dolby Digital, Dolby Atmos (Blu-ray only), DTSHDR formats HDR10Dimensions (hwd) 39 x 10 x 26cmWeight 4.5kgThe PS5’s controller is the first real indication that Sony has opted to go beyond sheer processing power and aimed for a more holistic upgrade encompassing the way games feel and sound.The new DualSense is a massive step up from its DualShock predecessor, and is packed with technology that helps immerse you in the games you play in new and inventive ways.It’s all down to a series of motors that provide haptic feedback as well as resistance in the triggers. None of this can be said of the new Xbox.Its credentials as an all-in-one entertainment device are rather dented by its complete lack of Dolby Vision, although with Dolby Atmos across the board coming soon, we feel that Sony may actually be taking steps to make the PS5 an all-rounder entertainment machine.Besides, the majority of people will buy a next-gen console for next-gen gaming, and it's the PS5 that delivers this most effectively – not in terms of resolution and frame rates, which are no higher here than from the Xbox – but in terms of new, game-changing tech and a dazzling user experience.MORE:Read our Our pick of the reviewLabelsTitlereviewLoadMoreShowMorehawkFooterDescriptionpoweredByLabel   Social Links NavigationWhat Hi-Fi?, founded in 1976, is the world's leading independent guide to buying and owning hi-fi and home entertainment products.

Nintendo Switch OLED The latest Switch models makes a hugely telling upgrade to its screen for a transformative change in presentation, but runs all the same games as the standard version. It's now been a few years since Nintendo shook up its Switch lineup with a new model that upgraded the console's built-in screen massively. Price and specs  There are some key differences between the Switch OLED and the standard Switch that can be summed up pretty easily by comparing them directly. The Nintendo Switch OLED has a number of new features - a larger screen, for starters - but beneath the hood, it's essentially the same as the existing Switch.

This effectively means that all the same Nintendo Switch games work across both consoles. There are a few key differences between the Nintendo Switch (OLED model) and the original Switch. The Switch OLED is fractionally longer and slightly heavier, but you really won't notice the difference. That means the Switch OLED comes with a 7-inch display without increasing the size of the console itself. Colour options While both consoles come in the classic 'Neon' colour option (one Joy-Con is blue, the other is red), the Switch OLED is also available in a standout white option, which looks nice and clean. There have been several special edition versions of the standard Switch over the years, as well as a grey variant, and these are now typically produced for the OLED instead, such at the current impressive   Storage The Nintendo Switch (OLED model) comes with double the storage capacity, which means you will be able to install twice as many games. It's also worth noting that the dock for the Switch OLED is also available to purchase separately and is compatible with the older Switch. Conclusion  If you already own a Switch, it's a tough upsell to upgrade to the OLED, especially if you play mostly on the TV, where you'll notice almost literally no differences.

Picking up over three decades after the events of Top Gun, this film once again follows Pete "Maverick" Mitchell (Tom Cruise), but this time he is brought back to the Top Gun program to be an instructor for graduates. You don't go to a film like Top Gun: Maverick for the story, but it also delivers on that front.
