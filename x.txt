Kicking myself for taking five turns on today's Wordle, given four of the letters feature in the ten most common in the game. Still, it's one of those answers where a number of possible letters can fit when your three core ones have turned green.I began with my new favorite start word: ORATE. Although it features all five of the most common letters in the game, today it was too clever by half, revealing just a green 'E'.That left exactly 100 answers, according to WordleBot, which isn't awful but could have been so much better. SLATE leaves 36 possible answers, while PLATE knocks this down to 18. If you played TRIPE this morning, just five answers would remain.I wanted to test the next most popular letters next, and that list includes 'L', 'I', 'S', 'N' and 'C'. SLIME seemed like a pretty good way of getting three of these in while keeping 'E' in position, so I went for it and to my delight both 'S' and 'I' went green. That reduced the number of possible answers to just nine*.(Image credit: Alan Martin)Immediately, I thought it was going to be either SWIPE or SNIPE. So I was left somewhat surprised when typing in the latter turned the 'P' yellow, as I hadn't considered any of the three options beginning 'SP'.Playing SNIPE actually actually ruled out one of those, as it could no longer be SPINE. But that still left two possibilities, and I picked the wrong one when I typed SPIKE instead of SPICE.That was silly on my part, given I previously said that 'C' was one of the ten most common letters in the game, but there we are. Lesson learned on my way to a five-turn win with SPICE.Hopefully you played better than me today, Wordlers. See you tomorrow. * The list of nine possible answers in full: SPICE, SPIKE, SHINE, SWINE, SPINE, SEIZE, SWIPE, SNIDE and SNIPE.Yesterday's Wordle answerReading this in a later time zone? The Wordle answer for game #793 was BEACH.Hello Wordlers. Today's puzzle answer cause most players too many problems, given it's a well-known word and it features the two most common letters in the game: 'E' and 'A'. I'm happy with a four-turn win, though really my third guess was a mistep and I should have spent a bit longer thinking about it.But I'm getting ahead of myself. I began with my new pick of the , ORATE. If you missed my change from RATIO, it was because ORATE is an anagram of the five most common letters in the game.Today, it uncovered both 'E' and 'A', with the latter turning green for a great start. Indeed, WordleBot says that with these two letters confirmed, just 12 possible answers were left over*.Not many of WordleBot's recommended start words beat that, though plenty match it. SLATE, DEALT and PLATE all leave 12 answers as well, though TRACE does knock that all the way down to three.(Image credit: Alan Martin)Where possible, I like to test the next tier of popular letters next, which includes 'L', 'I' and 'S'. With two vowels already uncovered, though, I decided 'I' wasn't necessary, so opted for LEANS. But, because the three remaining letters are all pretty rare, all this did was confirm the position of 'E'. Five possible answers remained.Here's where I made a mistake. PEAKY was never going to be a likely answer as a Britishism, but I thought there was a good chance there would be a 'Y' at the end. There wasn't, and all I'd done was rule out three more letters.Fortunately, this only left one answer: BEACH. I typed it in and celebrated a four-turn win.Hopefully you did it in three or under today, Wordlers. See you tomorrow. * The 12 answers WordleBot identified were: BEACH, HEADY, HEAVY, PEACH, BEADY, LEAFY, LEAKY, LEACH, LEASH, EMAIL, SEAMY and MEALY.Previous Wordle answersIf you're looking for a list of older Wordle answers, we can also help.

I can't stress this enough — it makes a massive difference.Without one, you'll be scrabbling around in the dark trying (and possibly failing) to find the right five letters (or possibly fewer) out of the 26 possibles. But clever people (not me) have done the math and identified the best start words based on both frequency in English and frequency among Wordle answers. So use them! Secondly, think about combinations, especially at the start and end. Some options are far more common than others — for instance, SH, ST, CR and CH all feature frequently. Vowels obviously need consideration too: not all Wordle answers will contain more than one, but plenty do, and some even have three. A good Wordle start word should have used a couple, but if they don't feature you might well want to try another one or two on your next go. Plus, remember the Y — this sometimes acts as a surrogate vowel, and is easy to forget. It also appears at the end of plenty of words.Finally, try out possibilities. So long as you don't press 'Enter' you can try possible answers to see how they look on screen. Put in likely letters plus any you know are definitely in the word, then mentally change one to the other available options. This technique has worked for me multiple times, and it's particularly helpful when the word in question is not an obvious one (like FJORD or ISLET). But if you're still struggling with Wordle, check out how Tom's Guide's Wordle experts have honed their strategy after .We also have plenty of Wordle tips and tricks to share, like how we've  and have some further advice for you there. And if you're new to the game you should also take a look at our  guide.What else should I know about Wordle?Wordle officially launched in October 2021, but actually started in June of that year and celebrated its first birthday on June 19, 2022.

John II   I used to use SUITE which uses 3 common vowels and 2 common consonants. Lately, it seems like some of the words have been a bit more obscure, so I've switched to HAVER (thanks goes out to The Proclaimers and 500 Miles for this obscure word). If no hits, that's fine, I burn some more letters to narrow the field by using two more vowels and other common consonants... MOIST. Yeah, I know... no one likes MOIST, but it reveals two more vowels and three more consonants . That combo helped me get today's HAIRY on the third guess! 🆒           Nhobuna   The may 10th answer might also be a double. I was working through it but I have a b,u, and t as letters that are in the actual word.           TexTechie   There are 2 answers again evidently.. I have the same word as you and it's not gecko obviously 😅           Scotth71   Far from Gecko for me. Not sure what is going on but seems someone has mucked up.           SS2021user   Was in the exakt same position with the end of 335, but chose wrong. Didn't think GAMER would be a very likely word, so I chose GAZER instead. Goodbye 40 day streak!           Jarmeister   Ugh. Today's (#344) was near impossible for a non native English speaker. Word I've only heard in couple of songs and would probably not use naturally in conversation.           JES2000   I'm surprised to see the misspelled "alright" in a wordle story.           SS2021user   I got Wordle 348 in 3 guesses as well, but I got... slightly luckier with my second guess. After guessing STARE I guessed PHONY, leaving me with 1 possible solution, and 4 green letters.           R_macus   Streak ended with #357. Stare, House, poise, loose, moose, noose.
