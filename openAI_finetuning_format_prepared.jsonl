Sonic Eclipse Online’s development team ignored Roblox’s chat facilities in favour of the popular third-party chatroom, Discord, where more advanced functionality made it easier to communicate and allowed freer use of language.Rachel*, like Green, started playing Roblox when she was six, drawn to the range of games on offer and the community of children with similar
